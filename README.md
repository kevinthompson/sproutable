This project was my entry into the 2011 [10k Apart Contest](http://10k.aneventapart.com/), in which the goal was to create a responsive web application in only 10k of data. That year, my entry won "Best Design."

My entry no longer works on the 10k Apart site due to expired Yelp API credentials, but this version can be run independently with valid credentials.
